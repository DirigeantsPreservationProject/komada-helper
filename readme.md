# Komada

Create new pieces and check your `schema.json` for the [Komada](https://komada.js.org/) framework.

## Features

### `schema.json` schema

The `schema.json` file (added in Komada 0.20) has tooltips, descriptions, default values and is checked for errors.

### Create new pieces

Easily create new pieces with the `newPiece` command. After a couple of questions a new file is created and prefilled.
